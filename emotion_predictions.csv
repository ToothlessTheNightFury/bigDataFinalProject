"Oriana frowns as she stares up into the clouds \""Hmph. I shall admit, your \'everstorm\' is quite grand. Why, the sheer size alone would make even she who bestowed the curse upon my lineage envious of its tenacity.\"" \""But!\"" She snaps her fingers, creating a boom like a burst of thunder \""A true Scion of Zetylyn cannot settle!

"There's a squeak from the bed. A soft grunt as Elena works up the strength to drag herself over to the side. Then a warm hand, settling atop Katias shoulder, giving it a reassuring squeeze. A hug would've been ideal, but this was all she could manage right now \""Not a war of conquest, but a war of subjugation all the same.\"" She murmurs, staring down at the bed \""I know how it feels to look a person in the eye after you've murdered their husband. Their sons. Then to justify how that -somehow- makes them safer. I've felt the hate and disgust they have towards people like me, how all they see is the personification of the TSC's wrath.\"" \""It hurts. It hurts so much being forced to do wrong.

Realizing she let her emotions get the best of her, she clears her throat, then looks back up towards Katia \""Sorry. I... probably said too much.
